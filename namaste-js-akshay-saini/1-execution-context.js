"Everything in javascript happens inside an Execution object."

"Execurion context has two components"

    "1. Memory - it is also called as Variable environment"
        "This is where all the variables and functions are stored in an key value pair"

    "2. Code - It is also called as Thread of execution"
        "This is the place where code is excuted lie by line . One code at a time."

"Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language - this means js can only execute one code at a time in a specific order. It will only go to next line when the current line execution completes."
